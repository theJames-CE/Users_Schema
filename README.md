<h1>Assignment: Users</h1><br>

<b>Learning Objectives:</b><br>

<li>Students will create databases using the three types of relationships.</li><br>

<li>Students will use SQL queries.</li><br>

In the previous chapter, you created users_schema. Now, you'll get the chance to forward engineer this schema, and use queries to manipulate the database.

If you get stuck on retrieving, changing, sorting, or deleting users, be sure to apply the 20 minute rule! Try re-reading the previous modules and doing research on your own, then reaching out to your peers on Discord, and finally setting up some time with a Coding Dojo staff member so that you talk through the challenge you're facing.
